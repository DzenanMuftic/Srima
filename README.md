## Booking

Visitors can request bookings through `booking.html` using the calendar interface.
Reservations are stored in the repository's `reservations.json` file served at
`https://dzenanmuftic.github.io/Srima/reservations.json`.
Access the admin dashboard at `admin.html` (login `admin` / `admin123`) to review
requests on a calendar and approve pending bookings.
